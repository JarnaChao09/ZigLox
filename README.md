# ZigLox

Following cLox implementation of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) with [Henock Dinberu](https://github.com/nbybhen). See their repository [here](https://github.com/nbybhen/ziglox)

The primary purpose of this project is to follow the bytecode interpreter Lox implementation, known as cLox, in Zig. 

This project hopes to achieve two goals.
1. Learn and improve at Zig (0.13.0 is the latest version as of writing).
1. Complete part 3 of Crafting Interpreters.
    - Previous attempts in [C++](https://github.com/JarnaChao09/Innovation_PL_Cpp) and [Rust](https://github.com/JarnaChao09/Innovation_PL_Rust) did not fully complete part 3 of Crafting Interpreters.
